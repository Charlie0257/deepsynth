# DeepSynth
A framework for effective training of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents when the reward is sparse and non-Markovian, but at the same time progress towards the reward requires achieving an unknown sequence of high-level objectives. The framework uses human-interpretable automata, synthesised from trace data generated through exploration of the environment by the deep RL agent, to uncover this sequential structure.  <br/>
Based on work presented in 'DeepSynth: Automata Synthesis for Automatic Task Segmentation in Deep Reinforcement Learning'.<br>
